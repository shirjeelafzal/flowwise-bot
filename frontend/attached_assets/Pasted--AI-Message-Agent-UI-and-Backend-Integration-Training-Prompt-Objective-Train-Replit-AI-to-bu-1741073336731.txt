**AI Message Agent UI and Backend Integration Training Prompt**

## Objective:
Train Replit AI to build an AI-powered Message Agent UI that handles incoming messages from multiple channels and connects to a backend for structured responses and appointment scheduling. The AI should integrate seamlessly with SMS, email, WhatsApp, and social media APIs, enabling automation and human escalation when needed. The codebase should be stored in a database for continuous updates and improvements.

## 1. Core Features of the AI Message Agent

### Multi-Channel Integration:
- Connect to SMS, live chat, email, WhatsApp, social media DMs, and website chat.
- Use APIs such as Twilio, WhatsApp Business API, Meta Messenger API, and email automation tools like Zapier and SendGrid.

### Word Board Response System:
- Predefined message templates categorized by inquiry type (e.g., pricing, services, availability).
- AI selects the most appropriate response while allowing for customization.

### Lead Qualification & Appointment Scheduling:
- Asks relevant questions to assess client fit.
- Integrates with scheduling tools such as Calendly, HubSpot, and Acuity Scheduling.

### Follow-Ups & Reminders:
- Tracks conversation history to send personalized follow-ups.
- Sends reminders and confirmations via SMS or email.

### Learning & Optimization:
- AI adapts responses based on customer interactions.
- Admin dashboard provides analytics on engagement and conversion rates.

## 3. Steps to Build & Deploy

### 1. Train the AI on Word Board Responses
- Define common customer inquiries and ideal responses.
- Use OpenAI’s fine-tuning or embeddings to match questions with the best answer.

### 2. Set Up Multi-Channel Integration
- Use APIs to connect the chatbot with SMS, email, social media, and live chat.
- Ensure a central dashboard for managing all conversations.

### 3. Implement Appointment Booking Logic
- AI should recognize appointment-related keywords.
- Use an API to check availability and book appointments automatically.

### 4. Automate Follow-Ups & Reminders
- Set up triggers for follow-ups if a customer doesn’t book right away.
- Use SMS/email reminders before scheduled appointments.

### 5. Test & Optimize
- Run test conversations to refine AI responses.
- Monitor conversion rates and tweak messaging for better results.

## 5. Deployment & Hosting

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Install Gradio (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   pip install gradio
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script (chatbot.py):**
   ```python
   import gradio as gr

   class AIMessageAgent:
       def __init__(self, word_board):
           self.word_board = word_board

       def get_response(self, user_message):
           keyword_map = {...}  # Mapping predefined in the full doc
           for keyword, response_name in keyword_map.items():
               if keyword in user_message:
                   return self.word_board.get(response_name, "I'm happy to assist! Could you provide more details?")
           return "I'm here to help! What size mattress are you interested in?"
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. **Test the Chatbot:**
   - Launches a local web server for testing.
   - Generates a shareable public link.
